# Or_projects
 this is a repository for mentoring or's projects.
 every project will be monitored here. learning and final.
 for ease of access to both of us.
 
 ## Rules
 1. every project will be in seperate folder. and will contain:
    - all the .c and .h files for the project.
    - .c files will be inside "src" folder.
    - .h files will be inside "include" folder.
    - the prject will include a makefile to compile the project
 2. ***no binaries allowed inside the project folder.***
 3. to work with this repository:
    - fork this repo to your account.
    - clone the repo inside your account to your local machine.
    - branch for every feature, commit, and push in small chunks to your repo (well you dont have to, but this is for you, saves alot of headaches, 
      especially in the final project. trust me)
    - when ready make a pull request to send me your code

good luck!!!
